    "The website scraped is the Official Gazette of the Philippines (https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/section/executive-orders/), the country's repository of legal documents. In particular, the section on executive orders. This site was chosen because legal documents are typically not hosted on APIs, and the site itself contains this information in a structured manner across different portals. Access to timely and effective jurisprudence is key to several undertakings that aim to democratize access to legal information, as well as a bevy of research into the natural-language processes of legal domains using AI (Dyevre, 2021; Ibarra & Revilla, 2014; Peramo et al., 2021; Virtucio et al., 2018).

    "- Making sure the order of operations made sense. You need to make sure to add `sleep()`, `refresh()`, and the like to make sure the pages are rendered before you try to look for elements. Additionally, if you use loops to iteratre through multiple pages, you have to make sure the pages' selectors are updated to avoid `StaleElementExceptions` which cropped up often.\n",
    "- Sometimes the page will throw errors because of your internet (relevant during the rainy season.) Important to refresh and check if it's an internet problem bc that slowed down the debugging process and was a red herring if the error happens in the middle of a scraping cycle, which will not throw a `ConnectionError` \n"
